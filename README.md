# Keyed Caesar Cipher

The Keyed Caesar Cipher involves the encryption of messages where the alphabet to be 'keyed' is created by  using a word which is known as the key. This module includes an implementation of the Keyed Caesar cipher. The program accepts a users message and key and either encodes or decodes their message. This module was created using Python's Flask framework for the back-end and HTML and CSS for the front-end.
